You can get a list of the largest tables to truncate using

SELECT 
    table_name AS `Table`, 
    round(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) `Size in MB` 
FROM information_schema.TABLES 
WHERE table_schema = "$DB_NAME"

You can usually truncate the audit tables, activities, activities_users and campaign_log without any trouble.

Once you get the list of tables in excel, you can then make a package to truncate the tables using:

="$query"&ROW()&" = 'truncate "&A2&"'; $results = $GLOBALS['db']->query($query"&ROW()&");"
