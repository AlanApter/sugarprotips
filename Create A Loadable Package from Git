Step 1:

Make sure you can pull the pull request. You can do that by modifiying the git file to include the following line:
        fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*
		
Step 2:
git fetch origin
git fetch --all

Step 3:

Checkout the pr. For example, for me this was:
git checkout pr/3

Step 4:

latestcommit=$(git log --pretty=format:'%h' -n 1)
git --no-pager diff --name-only $latestcommit $latestcommit~

Step5:
cp --parents `git --no-pager diff --name-only $latestcommit $latestcommit~` ../path/to/where/your/package/is

Step 6:
Add a manifest file

Step 7:

Package it up.
